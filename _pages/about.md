Since April 2022, I am a PhD student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu).
In the [group of Prof. Dr. Klemens BÃ¶hm](https://dbis.ipd.kit.edu/), I work on the design of databases for applications in the humanities.

I am a member of [The Helmholtz Pilot Program Core-Informatics at KIT](https://www.kikit.kit.edu/), funded by the [Helmholtz Association](https://www.helmholtz.de/).
Within this program, I work on time series compression using explicit domain knowledge.

Both research directions are combined in my dissertation project: an end-to-end database and query system for the [Google Books Ngram Corpus](https://books.google.com/ngrams/) and similar temporal n-gram corpora.
A prototype of this system is called [ngramSQL](https://ngramsql.com).

![A schematic overview of my dissertation project: Three boxes are arranged next to each other, titled "Data Representation", "Query System Implementation", and "Data Reliability" from left to right. "Data Representation" contains two sub-boxes, "Time Series Compression" and "External Knowledge". "Query System Implementation" also contains two sub-boxes, one saying "Information Requirements" (top) and one subdivided even further, into "User Interface" and "Data Storage" (bottom). An arrow points from the upper to the lower sub-box. "Data Reliability" also has two sub-boxes, "Corpus Composition" and "Data Quality". Above the three boxes, the research goal is summarized as "Lowering the Technical Barriers for Analysis of the Google Books Ngram Corpus", with arrows pointing towards this summary from the three previously mentioned boxes.](images/building_blocks_full.png)
